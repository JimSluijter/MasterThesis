function [ang] = counterClockWiseAngle(vec1,vec2,normalVec)
%COUNTERCLOCKWISEANGLE returns angle between vec1 and vec2, measured in
%counterclockwise direction. Accordingly, the possible output ranges from 0
%to 360. The last input argument specifies the normal plane on which the
%two vectors lie (and therefore the direction in which the angle is
%measured)
%   Output in degrees.
%   INPUT
%   vec1: 3-by-1 vector
%   vec2: 3-by 1 vector
