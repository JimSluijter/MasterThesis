classdef oriVec < matlab.mixin.Copyable
    %ORIVEC a vector in 3D. Is used for crease direction vectors and for
    %face normals. Is intended to work like a pointer s.t. vectors don't
    %always have to be written to several faces, vertices and edges.
    
    properties
        vec(3,1) {mustBeReal,mustBeFinite} = [0;0;0]
        %the vector in 3D. Should be a unit vector, but this is not
        %checked.
    end
    
    methods
        function obj = oriVec()
            %ORIVEC trivial constructor of an oriVec
        end
    end
